            <p class="text">The main things I learnt are: <br>1. Being rich is a marathon race, not a 10-minute race. <br>2. Even if our environment is hard. You should know some people succeed more than me and grow in a more challenging
            environment than I also <br>3. Be wise when using social media, do not kill it or overuse it. There are some benefits you should exploit as much as
            possible. <br>4. Having a piece of knowledge in time management and how to focus are some of the keys to success in changing your life. <br>5. The first and most important thing in our life as Muslims is our religion “Islam” and all below it are nothing compared
            with it.</p>
